# Configuration

This file documents runtime configuration used by the server, Docker image, and
tests. Keep it in sync when environment variables or startup behavior changes.

## Core Runtime

- `PORT`: HTTP port. Defaults to `3000`.
- `NODE_ENV`: Enables production behavior such as secure cookies when set to
  `production`.
- `DATA_DIR`: Directory for runtime databases, secrets, uploads, and cache.
  Defaults to the repository root in local runs. Docker sets `DATA_DIR=/data`.
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: Admin JWT lifetime. Defaults to `30d`.
- `BCRYPT_ROUNDS`: Bcrypt cost factor. Defaults to `10`.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Optional static JWT secret. If omitted, `jwt.secret` is created
  under `DATA_DIR`.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Optional static encryption key. If omitted, `secret.key` is
  created under `DATA_DIR`.
- `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Optional first admin password. If omitted, a random
  password is generated and printed on first startup.

## Per-User Provider Access

Administrators can enable the stored `provider_access` setting separately for
each normal user. It is disabled by default and controls only upstream provider
management and connection-details visibility. A user without it still receives
their own provider names/options and catalog rows so they can edit channel,
movie, and series lists, including category-scoped EPG mappings. Administrators
are not restricted by this setting.

## Optional AI

The AI integration is **experimental**, including both API and ChatGPT connections.
API connections are configured in the **AI Assistant** Web UI, without additional
environment variables or services. Personal ChatGPT connections also need the
runtime described below. The central policy is stored in `settings.ai_policy`;
it defaults to disabled. Administrators explicitly select allowed users by name and allowed functions,
may share an admin connection with selected users, and can allow private user
connections. A user must also activate their own AI preferences.

Automatic cleanup rules recheck account and Web UI access, the applicable user
and function allowlists, and both server and personal AI enablement before
applying. Revoked access skips application without deleting the stored rule.
Already confirmed literal rules do not require a model connection to run.

Public API targets require HTTPS. `internal_targets` allows exact normalized
base URLs (including proxy prefixes) for administrator-approved internal
services; it never allows CIDR ranges, metadata addresses, redirects or insecure
TLS. An approved internal endpoint may use HTTP and no key. This policy does
not change IPTV provider/EPG networking. See [AI setup](AI_INTEGRATION.md).

Connection API keys use the existing `ENCRYPTION_KEY`/`secret.key` AES-GCM
encryption. Keep that key backed up separately from the database; access to both
allows decryption. Ordinary user backups, clones and system exports do not
include AI connections. Re-enter credentials and retest after importing a user.

## Optional personal ChatGPT connection

A second, separate AI connection type lets each user and each administrator link
**their own** ChatGPT account through the official Codex sign-in, without an
OpenAI platform API key. Packaged installations enable the runtime; AI access
still requires the administrator's policy and each user's preferences. It is offered only when
the server can prove that the Codex runtime is contained by an operating-system
sandbox. It never replaces the API connection type described above.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_CODEX_ENABLED` | `false` in the standard Compose stack; `true` in the ChatGPT overlay, image, installer and example environment; otherwise `false` | Master switch. While false, nothing is started and the connection type is not offered. Existing explicit settings are preserved by the updater. |
| `AI_CODEX_BIN` | `codex` | Path to the pinned Codex CLI, or a bare name resolved once against `PATH`. A relative path is resolved against the manager's working directory. The resolved absolute path is both version-probed and launched; the executable, the target of a symlinked launcher and the interpreter of a script launcher are bound read-only as individual files, and a resolved package root as a directory, so a global npm install works without carrying a launcher's unrelated neighbours into the sandbox. A launcher placed in or above `DATA_DIR` is refused (`AI_CODEX_BINARY_UNSAFE_LOCATION`), because mounting it would expose the database and the encryption key; keep it in a normal system location. Its reported version must fall inside the tested range (see [AI setup](AI_INTEGRATION.md)). |
| `AI_MODEL_TEST_BATCH_MS` | `300000` | Budget for one whole compatibility test, however many models and probes it contains (clamped to 1 s – 15 min). Set it to the timeout of the proxy in front of the manager: there is no point in still making billable calls for a request nothing is waiting for. Models the batch could not reach are reported as untested. |
| `AI_CODEX_RUNTIME_DIR` | `$DATA_DIR/ai-codex` | Root for per-identity runtime directories, created with mode `0700`. A relative path — including one inherited from a relative `DATA_DIR` — is resolved against the working directory, because the sandbox needs absolute paths. Wherever it is placed, the sandbox masks the whole root and restores only the identity that is running, so one identity never reaches another's. |
| `AI_CODEX_SANDBOX` | `auto` | Isolation backend: `auto`, `bwrap`, `sandbox-exec`, or `none` to keep the adapter disabled. |
| `AI_CODEX_ALLOW_DEV_SANDBOX` | `false` | Accept a development-grade backend (macOS `sandbox-exec`). Not intended for hosted multi-user operation. |
| `AI_CODEX_VERSION_OVERRIDE` | unset | Accept one exact Codex version outside the tested range. Use only for a deliberate, separately validated upgrade. |

On Linux the supported backend is **bubblewrap** (`bwrap`), which gives the
runtime its own mount, PID, IPC, UTS and cgroup namespaces with only its own
identity directory writable. Install it in the image or host (`apt-get install
-y bubblewrap`) and keep the web process unprivileged; no Docker socket and no
host administration rights are required or granted. On startup the server runs a
canary self-test that must fail to read a file outside the sandbox and fail to
write into `DATA_DIR`. If the backend is missing, the self-test fails, or the
grade is only development, the adapter stays unavailable with a specific reason
and the connection type is not offered.

Credentials are stored encrypted with the same `ENCRYPTION_KEY`/`secret.key`.
The Codex credential file exists in clear text only inside the identity's own
`0700` directory while its runtime is live and is removed when it stops. The
server operator can read the application key by design; this is not encryption
against the operator.

### AI installation verification

The standard Docker image and Debian/Ubuntu installer provision Codex **0.154.0**
and bubblewrap. Manual Debian/Ubuntu installations run
`sudo bash scripts/install-ai-runtime.sh` after installing Node.js and npm.
Proxmox delegates to that same installer inside its unprivileged, nesting-enabled
container. Existing explicit `AI_CODEX_ENABLED=false` settings are not changed.
If optional ChatGPT provisioning fails during install/update, a warning is
reported and the core server installation/restart continues. Correct the reported
dependency problem and rerun the helper before using ChatGPT.

Run `npm run check:ai-runtime` **as the application user, not root**. It uses
temporary data, checks real filesystem containment, probes the installed
version, starts the app-server with the production restrictions and completes
its protocol handshake. It never signs in, loads existing credentials, or calls
a model. A missing/blocked runtime produces a nonzero exit code. Install/update
run it with `--if-enabled`; a failure warns rather than stopping the ordinary
server and API connection path.

Personal ChatGPT connections in Docker need the optional `docker-compose.chatgpt.yml`
overlay and the supplied `docker/ai-seccomp.json` and, on AppArmor hosts, the
loaded `iptv-manager-ai` profile in `docker/ai-apparmor`. Keep Docker's default
masked/read-only paths, capability set and PID isolation. Do **not** use
`privileged`, `SYS_ADMIN`, `seccomp=unconfined`, `apparmor=unconfined` or
`systempaths=unconfined`. The runtime uses a read-only synthetic `/proc` containing
only its fixed executable link; it exposes no process tree and does not need
to mount procfs inside Docker. The profile provenance and permissions are in
[docker/SECURITY-PROFILES.md](../docker/SECURITY-PROFILES.md).
The standard Compose/Portainer stack uses Docker defaults with
`AI_CODEX_ENABLED=false`; AI API connections remain available. Missing sandbox
files cannot be repaired by replacing the image, since Docker reads them before
container startup. See the [Portainer repair steps](../README.md#using-docker-compose-or-portainer).

On AppArmor-enabled Debian/Ubuntu hosts the helper installs a private,
root-owned bubblewrap executable under `/usr/local/lib/iptv-manager/bwrap`
and its enforced `iptv-manager-bwrap` profile. The application selects that
executable when present, otherwise the system bubblewrap. This leaves the
system-wide unprivileged-user-namespace restriction and other applications'
bubblewrap unchanged. A container that cannot load this profile needs its host
administrator; the helper reports that restriction rather than disabling it.

After a green preflight, configure the AI policy/preferences and complete a real
Web UI account link, model discovery/test, and disconnect. API-key connections
require their own endpoint/key/model test. These account-dependent checks are
separate from installation verification. Proxmox remains runtime-unverified
until this is exercised on a real Proxmox host.

## Network and Proxy

- `TRUST_PROXY`: Express trust proxy setting. Use this behind a reverse proxy
  that terminates HTTPS or forwards client IPs. **Render'da zorunludur
  (`TRUST_PROXY=1`)**: ayarlanmazsa tüm ziyaretçiler proxy IP'siyle görünür,
  IP beyaz listesi çalışmaz ve bir kişinin hatalı girişleri herkesi 3600sn
  engeller.
- `DISABLE_CLUSTER`: Set to `true` on low-RAM hosts (Render free, 512 MB) to
  run a single worker. Prevents OOM crashes during large imports.
- `RESTORE_PASSWORD`: Backup/restore password. When set and the database is
  empty on boot, the server automatically imports the newest `.bin` from the
  `backups` branch (see `RESTORE_REPO`/`RESTORE_BRANCH`). This recovers
  settings after ephemeral-filesystem wipes (Render free). Keep it identical
  to the `EXPORT_PASS` used by the backup workflow.
- `RESTORE_REPO`: GitHub repo holding the backup `.bin` files. Defaults to
  `steamixtvlive/steamix-ultimate-ui-panel`.
- `RESTORE_BRANCH`: Branch holding the backup `.bin` files. Defaults to
  `backups` (the auto-backup workflow pushes there, never to `main`, so
  backups don't trigger redeploys).

## Program-İçi Yedekleme (Actions Yok)

- `GITHUB_BACKUP_TOKEN`: Contents-write token. Ayarlanmazsa program-içi
  yedek kapalıdır.
- `GITHUB_BACKUP_PASSWORD` (veya eski adıyla `RESTORE_PASSWORD`): `.bin`
  şifresi. Yedekleme ve geri yükleme için şart.
- `GITHUB_BACKUP_REPO`: Varsayılan `steamixtvlive/steamix-ultimate-ui-panel`.
- `GITHUB_BACKUP_BRANCH`: Varsayılan `backups`.
- `GITHUB_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MIN`: Kaç dakikada bir yazılsın. Varsayılan `60`
  (en az 10, en çok 1440).
- `SEED_WHITELIST_IPS`: Virgüllü IP listesi. Her açılışta beyaz listeye
  eklenir, engelliyse engeli kalkar. Varsayılan `78.190.61.131`.
  DB silinip yeniden kurulsa bile geri gelir.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated CORS allowlist. By default cross-origin
  browser requests are blocked. `*` allows all origins and is not recommended
  for production.
- `API_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: Maximum requests per IP for general `/api`,
  Xtream API, XMLTV, and playlist endpoints within
  `API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`. Defaults to `1000`.
- `API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`: General API rate limit window in milliseconds.
  Defaults to `60000` (1 minute).
- `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: Maximum requests per IP for login, password changes,
  user creation/update, and backup restore/create endpoints within
  `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`. Defaults to `100`.
- `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`: Authentication-sensitive rate limit window in
  milliseconds. Defaults to `900000` (15 minutes).
- `CLIENT_LOG_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: Maximum unauthenticated client log submissions
  per IP within `CLIENT_LOG_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`. Defaults to `120`.
- `CLIENT_LOG_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`: Client log rate limit window in
  milliseconds. Defaults to `3600000` (1 hour).
- Provider `user_agent`: the per-provider User-Agent saved in the provider
  form is sent on every catalog sync request (Xtream API fallback, categories,
  VOD, series, M3U). Use it when a host blocks the default node agent and
  sync returns 0 channels. Empty syncs now report the per-type reason
  (HTTP status / error) in the sync response instead of silent zeros.

## Stream Tracking

- `REDIS_URL`: Optional Redis connection URL for active stream tracking across
  workers or instances. When Redis is unavailable or not configured, the
  SQLite `current_streams` table is used instead.
- `STREAM_MAX_AGE_MS`: Hard safety cap for stale stream sessions. Defaults to
  `86400000` (24 hours).
- `STREAM_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS`: Inactivity timeout for stream sessions.
  Defaults to `120000` (2 minutes).

## Scheduled Jobs and GeoIP

- `IS_SCHEDULER`: Internal cluster flag used by the primary process when
  starting the scheduler worker.
- `MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY`: Optional MaxMind license key for GeoLite2 updates.
  The Web UI security settings can also provide this value. Startup checks
  MaxMind checksum files first and skips the heavy `geoip-lite` updater when
  the local GeoIP database is already current.

## EPG Downloads

EPG imports still validate URLs with the SSRF-safe fetch path, including
redirect re-checks and DNS rebinding protection. HTTPS EPG sources may use
self-signed certificates; this exception is scoped to EPG downloads and does
not disable TLS certificate validation globally or for stream proxy requests.

## Docker Notes

The Docker image builds on Node.js 24 Alpine and uses `/data` for mutable
runtime files and `/app` for application code and dependencies. The entrypoint
may recursively fix ownership of `/data` for older root-owned volumes, but it
must not recursively chown `/app` because `/app/node_modules` can be large and
make startup slow. GeoIP updates are persisted under `/data/geoip` by symlinking
`/app/node_modules/geoip-lite/data` there at container start, so updated MaxMind
data survives container recreation.

Keep runtime files out of Git and Docker build context:

- `db.sqlite*`
- `epg.db*`
- `secret.key`
- `jwt.secret`
- `cache/`
- `temp_*`
- `temp_uploads/`
